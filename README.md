## Description
this project focuses on the implementation of AI algorithms that treat the world as continuous space and navigate it in order to find the shortest path to a goal, in our case the ghosts try to find the shortest path to Pacman in order to capture it. 

The project is based on the Pacman game and the simulator is provided by UC Berkeley.

we've implemented the following algorithms:
1. PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) with Dijkstra algorithm and A* algorithm
2. RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) and RRT* with Dijkstra algorithm
3. Grid based algorithms: BFS, A* ***(?)***

all algorithms have been implemented from scratch and have the required infrastructure to work with heuristics.
